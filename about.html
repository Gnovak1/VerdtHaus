     <div class="grid3">
         <p> Viola Truttman is a farmer from Hochbaumstrasse Bern, Switzerland. From the beginning she believed in making the world a better and cleaner place. She would start small with simply proper recycling. She would then start to volunteer to help pick up trash and plant trees. Truttman decided to persue agriculture at the Univeristy of Bern, there she learned how to better herself and those around her for the environment. Shortly after graduating, Truttman inherited her family farm. Knowing this was a chance to change the world around her, she explored and came up with ways to be a greener, cleaner farmer.  </p>

    <p>Here at Verdt Haüs we strive to make ourselves and those around us as environmentally conscious as we can. Our goal is to transition what we can into green technology, starting with our farms. Just because our technology is advanced, doesn't mean it's green.We care about the environment, and we want you to care too. The more we grow, the more we can do for our planet.  <br><br>There's no reason to go about it alone! If you want to help our environment, we'll help you too! </p>
